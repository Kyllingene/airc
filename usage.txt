Usage:
airc [input_file...] [options]

Compile one or more air input files into brain*.
If multiple input files are specified, and only
one output file, all files will be compiled into
the same output file. If multiple output files
are specified, there must be exactly as many as
there are input files, and they will be outputted
into their positionally respective files. If `-s`
is specified, prints all output to stdout. If
only one input file, creates a new file and names
it the same, except with the `.bf` extension. If
multiple input files and no output specified,
outputs to `out.bf`.

Options:
    -h | --help   : Show this help prompt.
    -o | --output : Specifify an output file. You
                    may specifiy more than one by
                    separating them with commas.
    -s | --stdout : print compiled code to stdout
